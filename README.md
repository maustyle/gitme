# gitme
This is a script to manage all of your local git repos 

In order to use this script you must enter in all of the file/paths to your local git REPOS into the REPOS array in gitme.sh

I recommend creating an alias in your .bash_profile per the following example...

alias gitme='sh /Users/you/gitme.sh'

the script will prompt you for input and you can reply "push" "pull" "commit" "ftp push" or "status"
